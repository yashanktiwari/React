# Reconciliation Algorithm (React Fiber):
- React creates a virtual DOM of the actual UI.
- Virtual DOM is not the actual dom, it is just an representation of actual DOM.
- Virtual DOM is react objects (normal javascript object).

# Diff Algorithm:
- It finds the difference between the updated virtual DOM and the old virtual DOM.
- It will calculate the difference and update the actual DOM.


## This whole algorithm is called as React Fiber (REACT 16)
