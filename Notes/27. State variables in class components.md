# State variables in class component:
- State variables are defined in the constructor of the class
- This is the best place to create them because every time an instance of class is created, the constructor will be called.

# Creating a state variable:
- Representation:
- constructor(props) {
-     super(props);
- 
-     this.state = {
-         count: 0,
-         count2: 0,
-     }
- }

# Using a state variable
- <h1>Count: {this.state.count}</h1>
- we can also destructure it.

# Updating the state variables:
- NOTE: NEVER EVER UPDATE THE STATE VARIABLES DIRECTLY LIKE: this.state.count = this.state.count + 1;
- Above condition will increment the value but UI will not be changed as in this way react wont be able to track it.

- For updating, REACT provides us with a function that is: this.setState({});
- Usage:
- <button onClick={() => {
-     this.setState({
-         count: this.state.count + 1
-                   OR
-         count: count + 1
-     });
- }}></button>
