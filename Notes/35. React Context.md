# React Context:
- If the hierarchy is very deep, i.e. from parent component to child component to child component and so on..
- So if we want to pass the data from the parent to its leaf, then it is a difficult task
- Here comes the use case of "React Context"
- It is like the global storage of data, where the data is stored and every component can directly access it.

# Creating User Context:
- createContext(): Given by react
- Syntax:
- const UserContext = createContext({
-   loggedInUser: defaultUser
- });

# Using the context (Functional Components):
- To use the context, we use a hook i.e.: "useContext"
- Syntax:
- const data = useContext(UserContext); // UserContext is the name of the context that is created

# Using the context (Class Based Components):
- To use the context in class based components, we do:

- import UserContext from "path";
- Now use a component:
  - <UserContext.Consumer>
    - Here we have the access to the data
    - {(data) => {console.log(data)}}
  - </UserContext.Consumer>

- Example (See in UserClass component):
- <UserContext.Consumer>
-     {({loggedInUser}) => (
-         <h1>{loggedInUser}</h1>
-     )}
- </UserContext.Consumer>

# Updating the context:
- This can be done using context provider
- See the example in the App.js file
- In that file, UserContext.Provider is providing the context to every component in the app as it is wrapped over everything
- If we will wrap the UserContext.Provider to a specific part of the application, then that context will be available in that part of the application only.

- We can also do something like this:
- // Default value
- <UserContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser: " Yashank "}}>
-   // Yashank
-     <div className="app">
-       <UserContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser: " Elon Musk "}}>
-         // Only in header: Elon Musk
-         <Header />
-       </UserContext.Provider>      
-       <Outlet />
-     </div>
- </UserContext.Provider>
