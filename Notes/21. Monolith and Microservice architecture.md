# Monolith Architecture:
- One big project
- It contains code for UI, DB, Notifications, API i.e. everything
- If we want to change a small thing then we need to build and deploy the whole project again.

# Microservices Architecture:
- The project is divided into various small services
- Like UI, DB, API, Notifications
- These micro services interact with each other
- If we want to change a small thing in a service then we have to build and deploy only that service.
- These microservices run on their specific ports and connects to each other using them.
