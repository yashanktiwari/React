# Higher order functions:
- These are the functions that takes a component and returns a component.
- HOF takes a component, enhances it i.e. adds new features to it and returns it.
- Syntax:
const higherOrderFunction = (component) => {
    return enhanced component;
}

enhanced component is also a component which is a normal js function so it can also be written as:

const higherOrderFunction = (component) => {
    return () => {
        
    }
}
