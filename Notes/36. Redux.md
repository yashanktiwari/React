# Redux:
- It is not mandatory
- Should be used for only large scale projects
- It offers easy debugging

- Link: https://redux.js.org/

- Some problems with the vanilla redux, which led to redux toolkit:
  - Configuring the store was very complex
  - Had to add a lot of packages to use redux
  - Required too much boilerplate

- Alternatives of Redux are:
  - Zustand

# Redux Store:
- Consider it as the global place where a major portion of the data of the application is stored
- Every component can access it.
- It is like a very big object
- The store can be divided into various slices

# Slices:
- To keep the data separated, we make logical partitions and these partitions are known as slices.
- Eg. userSlice for logged in user info, cartSlice for the cart data
- Initially the cart slice can be empty, but when we put the data into it, it just modifies the cart slice

# Modifying the slices:
- Redux doesn't allow modifying the slices directly
- When we click on any button, the process is as follows:
  - It "dispatch" an action
  - It calls a function
  - This function modifies the slice
  - The function is known as Reducer.

- We can say:
  - When we click on the button, it dispatches the action. It calls the function (reducer) and it modifies the slice.

# Reading the data from the store:
- "selector" is used for reading the data from the redux store
- The phenomena of using selector is known as "subscribing to the store".
- It means that our selector is in sync with the store, so any changes in the store will be reflected by the selector
