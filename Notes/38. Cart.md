- Install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
- Build our store
- Connect our store to our app
- Slice (cartSlice)
- dispatch(action)
- selector

1. create a new file appStore, and create a new store using configureStore() function given by redux-toolkit.
- Syntax:
- import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
- 
- const appStore = configureStore({});
- 
- export default appStore;

2. Now we will provide the store to our application
- "Provider" -> provided by react-redux
Syntax:
<Provider store={ store that we created above }>
  // Whole application inside it. Go to App.js to see the example
</Provider>

3. Now create a slice
- For example, see the cartSlice.js file

4. Now add the slice to the store
- For example, see the appStore file

- Now we can read or write to the store


# Reading from the store using selector:
- We will use the "useSelector()" hook
- For example, see the header.js file
- The selector will also help us identify what portion of the store we need to read
- Eg.
- // Suscribing to the store using the selector
-   const cartItems = useSelector(store => store.cart.items);

# Adding to the store:
- const dispatch = useDispatch();
- "useDispatch()" is the hook - given by react-redux
- Now import the action that we exported from the slice
- Call the actions
- Syntax:
- const handleAddItem = () => {
-   // dispatch an action
-   dispatch(addItem("pizza"));
- }
- See example in ItemList.js

- Behind the scenes:
- React will create an object with a key "payload" and pass it as the second parameter as the action: {
  payload: "pizza"
}
