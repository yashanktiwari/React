- There are multiple ways to write CSS in react:
1. External CSS
    - Write the CSS in a new file

2. Inline CSS
    - we cannot directly write like:
        - style: "color: red; height: 200px"
    - Above format is wrong
    - In React, we have to write style as a javascript obj;
        - obj = {
            - height: 200px,
            - width: 100px
        - }
        - style = {obj};
