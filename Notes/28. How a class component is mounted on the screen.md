#
- Whenever the page is loaded, the page will be loaded line by line in the top to bottom fashion
- Whenever a component is encountered, then the component will be loaded
- Whenever the class component starts loading, first the "constructor" then the "render" function will be called.
- But the problem arises when both (parent and child) are class components.

# Case when both parent and child are class components:
- Loading hierarchy:
    - Parent constructor
    - Parent render
    - Child constructor
    - Child render

# componentDidMount():
- Another method that is provided to us by React
- It executes after the component is mounted.

# Case when both parent and child are class components with componentDidMount():
- Loading hierarchy:
    - Parent constructor
    - Parent render
    - Child constructor
    - Child render
    - Child componentDidMount
    - Parent componentDidMount

# Case when both parent and child are class components but there are multiple children:
- Loading hierarchy
    - Parent constructor
    - Parent render
    - Child 1 constructor
    - Child 1 render
    - Child 2 constructor
    - Child 2 render
    - Child 1 componentDidMount
    - Child 2 componentDidMount
    - Parent componentDidMount
- The reason for this kinda output can be seen by the react lifecycle diagram
