# Creating routing configuration:

- import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from 'react-router-dom';


- const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
-     {
-         path: "/",
-         element: <AppLayout />,
-         errorElement: <Error />
-     },
-     {
-         path: "/about",
-         element: <About />
-     },
-     {
-         path: "/contact",
-         element: <Contact />
-     }
- ]);

- root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);


##
- react-router-dom gives us a hook: "useRouteError", which is useful for showing more information about the error.


# Children routes:
- For children routes, we can use children: [] in the object
- <Outlet /> component to show different components in our application according to our routes.
- <Outlet /> component is replaced by other components.

# Link:
- <Link> tag:
    - Given by react-router-dom
    - Alternative for <a></a> tag
    - Without refreshing, go to that route
    - The concept of SPA (single page application) comes from here.
