# JSX
- JavaScript XML
- It is not HTML inside JavaScript
- It is HTML like structure
- It takes care of the malicious attacks that can be carried out by API calls.

- Browsers or JS engine dont understand JSX, they only understand ES6 (EcmaScript).

- Then how is the code working?
- Parcel is transpiling/converting the JSX code behind the scenes.

- Parcel is doing it all alone?
- No, actually babel is doing it, parcel is managing it

- If we are writting JSX in multiple lines, we have to wrap it in parenthesis: ()
- To tell babel, that from where JSX is starting and where it is ending
- In single lines, we dont need parenthesis.

- Eg
// jsx
- const jsxHeading = <h1 id="heading">Namaste React</h1>;
- console.log(jsxHeading); // an object

- const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
- root.render(jsxHeading);

# Babel
- JavaScript compiler
