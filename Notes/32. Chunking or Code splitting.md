# Chunking / Code Splitting:
- Different bundlers do one thing that is common that is to merge all our files into one javascript file.
- This is known as bundling.

- So should we do bundling or not?
- The answer depends on the test cases.
- Like we want all the files into combined into one, it makes it easier to load only one file
- But we don't want 1000 files to be bundles into one.

- So we bundle the files when they are required.
- This concept has so many names:
- Dynamic Bundling
- Lazy loading
- On demand loading
- Dynamic import

- If we want to do lazy loading then:
- React provides us a function named "lazy" as named export.
- lazy function takes a callback function as parameter.
Syntax:
const Component = lazy(() => import(path of the component));
- The import is a function that takes the path of the component as a parameter.

- Now consider a scenario where on click the code is coming but since react is very fast, it will try to load the component, but initially the code is not available as it will take some time to load. So react will suspend the call.
- To save us from this thing, we get another named export from react i.e.: "<Suspence />"
- We can wrap our component inside this component
- We give this Suspence a fallback (a placeholder) which will be displayed until the component is loaded
Syntax:
<Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading</h1>}><Component /></Suspense>
OR
<Suspense fallback={<Loading />}><Component /></Suspense>
