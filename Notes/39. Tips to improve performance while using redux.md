- Subscribe to the right portion of the store.
  - This is important because if we subscribe to the whole store, then for every small change in the store, the variables where the store is subscribed will update resulting that component to update again and again.

- Use the reducer and reducers keyword carefully.

- Older redux (Vanilla Redux):
- It does not allow to mutate the state.
- Instead, create a copy of the new state like: const newState = [...state];
- Now update the newState
- Return the newState (mandatory)

- Newer Version (Redux Toolkit):
- In this, we have to mutate the state (Its a compulsory thing)
- Redux is still doing the old thing but the developers need not do it.
- Redux does sthis with the help of "Immer" (finds the diff. b/w old and new state)
- RTK says either mutate the existing state or return a new state

NOTE:
- To print the current state, we cannot do console.log(state), we have to do:
- console.log(current(state));
- current will be named import from redux toolkit
