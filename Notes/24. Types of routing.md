# Types of routing in web apps:
- Client side routing
    - When we load the application for the first time, all the code loads into the browser.
    - So when want to go to that page, its code is already there so that is just loaded and no network call is made.
    - Because of this, the pages are not refreshed.

- Server side routing
    - Whenever we go to a page, that page is fetched from the server and then is displayed on the screen.
    - Because of this network call, the pages are refreshed every time.
